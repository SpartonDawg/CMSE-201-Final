Final Project by Dan Iancio, Phil Reynolds, Caden Bielawa, Jack Bartoluzzi

There's a lot of overlap in the files. The one with all of the used code is in CMSE_202_-_Final.ipynb.
If you run straight through the cells you should get most of the result minus a few plots that are commented out.
We note when this occurs. Contributions were largely overlaping though main contributors to specific functions are
named below.


Jack Bartoluzzi brought the framework of the project, large portions of back_testing and many of the portfolio functions
were put together by him.

Phil Reynolds wrote various modifications of testing using brackets, and contributed to attempts at machine learning. 

Dan Iancio pioneered the coding on the SMA/LMA form of testing, rewritting many of the functions to suit the new model.

Caden Bielawa contributed mostly to support, writing additional functions and refining existing functions for speed.

Additionally, each group member contributed to presentation preparation and everyone participated in weekly sunday meetings
working on the projects. All in all, the members of the group agree everyone participated fairly in the project.
